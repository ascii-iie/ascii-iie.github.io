Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning. Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%. </p>

However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity, while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models. Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise, respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. </p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution, explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution, which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs. </p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has gained significant attention for its ability to address data sparsity issue. However, most existing CDR methods focus primarily on improving recommendation accuracy while largely overlooking fairness considerations, which can lead to biased outcomes and unfair treatment of different user groups. To solve this critical problem, we investigate whether fairness can be transferred from the source domain to the target domain. Our analysis suggests that fairness can be effectively transferred if the fairness of the source domain is ensured and the distributions of the source and target domains are well aligned. Based on this, we propose the \textbf{FairCDR}, a novel framework that can achieve the knowledge transfer of fairness and user preferences simultaneously. FairCDR owns two phases: single-domain fairness guarantee and inter-domain distribution alignment. In the first phase, we employ an adversarial learning-based recommender (\textbf{ALR}) to disentangle user preferences from sensitive attributes in the source domain. In the second phase, we introduce a new mutual learning-based diffusion model (\textbf{MLDiff}), which engages in mutual learning with ALR to progressively align the distributions of the source and target domains. This improves ALR’s adaptability to distribution shifts, ultimately ensuring fairness and recommendation performance in the target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world cross-domain datasets demonstrate that FairCDR surpasses existing strong baselines in both fairness and recommendation quality.</p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal recommendation, which utilizes rich multimodal information to learn user preferences, has attracted significant attention. Most works focus on designing powerful encoders for extracting multimodal features, and simply aggregate the learned features together to make prediction. Consequently, they have a limited capacity to learn the inter-modality knowledge including the modality-shared and modality-unique knowledge. In fact, learning the modality-shared knowledge enables us to align cross-modality data for fusing heterogeneous modality features. Learning the modality-unique knowledge is equally important when recommendation tasks only involve a small amount of shared features and the necessary information is contained within specific modality. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Modality-Disentangled Learning (CMDL) to overcome this critical limitation. CMDL exactly captures the inter-modality knowledge by achieving modality disentanglement. Specifically, CMDL first disentangles the initial representation into the modality-invariant and modality-specific representations. Afterwards, CMDL introduces a novel manner of contrastive learning to approximate the MI upper bounds for achieving disentanglement regularization. Building upon the proposed regularization, CMDL encourages the modality-invariant and modality-specific representations to capture the modality-shared and modality-unique knowledge respectively and to be statistically independent to each other. Empirically, extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of CMDL compared with strong multimodal recommenders.</p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which attempts to identify OOD graphs originated from an unknown distribution, is a vital building block for safety-critical applications in Web and society. Current approaches concentrate on how to learn better graph representations, but fail to provide any statistically guarantee on detection results, therefore impeding their deployments in the scenario where detection errors would result in serious consequences. To overcome this critical issue, we propose the Conformal Graph-level Out-of-distribution Detection (CGOD), extending the theory of conformal prediction to graph-level OOD detection with a rigorous control over the false positive rate. In CGOD, we develop a new aggregated non-conformity score function based on the proposed adaptive data augmentation. Through the guidance from two designed metrics, i.e., score consistency and representation diversity, our augmentation strategy can generate multiple non-conformity scores, and aggregating these generated non-conformity scores together is robust to the misleading information. Meanwhile, our score function can perceive the subsequent process of conformal inference, enabling the aggregated non-conformity score to be adaptive to different input graphs and deriving a more accurate score estimation. We conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets with different empirical settings. Extensive results and model analyses demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over several competitive baselines.</p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: Graph anomaly detection has attracted significant attention due to its critical applications, such as identifying money laundering in financial systems and detecting fake reviews on social networks. However, two major challenges persist: (1) anomaly detection at the node, edge, and graph levels is often addressed in isolation, hindering the integration of complementary information to identify anomalies arising from collective behaviors; and (2) the inherent label sparsity in graph data, coupled with the difficulty of obtaining high-quality annotations, exacerbates bias in detection. To address these challenges, we propose UniFORM, a unified self-supervised anomaly detection framework comprising three modules: UIO, UMC and UPL. UIO unifies node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks from a subgraph perspective, leveraging an energy-based GNN for iterative multi-granular anomaly detection. UMC enhances meta-learning through contrastive learning and employs Langevin dynamics to generate phantom samples as substitutes for anomalous data, reducing reliance on labeled data. UPL design unified loss in intra-inter perspectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniFORM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple granularities.</strong></p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to learn representations of entities and relations of knowledge graph (KG). Recently Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained great success on KGE, but for the reason behind it, most views simply attribute to the well learning of knowledge graph structure, which still remains a limited understanding of the internal mechanism. In this work, we first study a fundamental problem, i.e., what are the important factors for GNNs to help KGE. To investigate this problem, we discuss the core idea of current GNN models for KG, and propose a new assumption of relational homophily that connected nodes possess similar features after relation’s transforming, to explain why aggregating neighbors with relation can help KGE. Based on the model and empirical analyses, we then introduce a novel data-centric framework for applying GNNs to KGE called KSG-GNN. In KSG-GNN, we construct a new graph structure from KG named Knowledge Similarity Graph (KSG), where each node connects with its similar nodes as neighbors, and then we apply GNNs on this graph to perform KGE. Instead of following the relational homophily assumption in KG, KSG aligns with homogeneous graphs that can directly satisfy homophily assumption. Hence, any GNN developed on homogeneous graphs like GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, etc., can be applied out-of-the-box as KSG-GNN without modification, which provides a more general and effective GNN paradigm. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., FB15k-237 and WN18RR, demonstrating the superior performance of KSG-GNN over multiple strong baselines.</p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse real-world applications. Traditional GNNs are designed based on homophily, which leads to poor performance under heterophily scenarios. Most current solutions deal with heterophily mainly by modeling the heterophily edges as data noises or high-frequency signals, treating all heterophilic edges as being of the same semantic. Consequently, they ignore the rich semantic information of these edges in heterophily graphs. To overcome this critic problem, we propose a novel GNN model based on relation vector translation named as Variational Relation Vector Graph Neural Network (VR-GNN). VR-GNN models relation generation and graph aggregation into an end-to-end model based on a variational inference framework. To be specific, the encoder utilizes the structure, feature and label to generate a fine-grained relation vector for each edge, which aims to infer its implicit semantic information. The decoder incorporates the generated relation vectors into the message-passing framework for deriving better node representations. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets with different homophily-heterophily properties to verify model effectiveness. Extensive experimental results show that VR-GNN gains consistent and significant improvements against existing strong GNN methods under heterophily and competitive performance under homophily.</p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Answering complex logical queries over
                                    knowledge graphs (KGs) is a fundamental yet challenging task. Recently, query
                                    representation has been a mainstream approach to complex logical reasoning,
                                    making the target answer and query closer in the embedding space. However, there
                                    are still two limitations. First, prior methods model the query as a fixed
                                    vector, but ignore the uncertainty of relations on KGs. In fact, different
                                    relations may contain different semantic distributions. Second, traditional
                                    representation frameworks fail to capture the joint distribution of queries and
                                    answers, which can be learned by generative models that have the potential to
                                    produce more coherent answers.To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel
                                    generative model, named DiffCLR, which exploits the diffusion model for complex
                                    logical reasoning to approximate query distributions. Specifically, we first
                                    devise a query transformation to convert logical queries into input sequences by
                                    dynamically constructing contextual subgraphs. Then, we integrate them into the
                                    diffusion model to execute a multi-step generative process, and a
                                    structure-enhanced self-attention is further designed for incorporating the
                                    structural features embodied in KGs. Experimental results on two benchmark
                                    datasets show our model effectively outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
                                    particularly in multi-hop chain queries with significant improvement.</p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data augmentation has been widely
                                    studied as it can be used to improve the generalizability of graph
                                    representation learning models. However, existing works focus only on the data
                                    augmentation on homogeneous graphs. Data augmentation for heterogeneous graphs
                                    remains under-explored. Considering that heterogeneous graphs contain different
                                    types of nodes and links, ignoring the type information and directly applying
                                    the data augmentation methods of homogeneous graphs to heterogeneous graphs will
                                    lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Aspect
                                    Heterogeneous Graph Augmentation framework named MAHGA. Specifically, MAHGA
                                    consists of two core augmentation strategies: structure-level augmentation and
                                    metapath-level augmentation. Structure-level augmentation pays attention to
                                    network schema aspect and designs a relation-aware conditional variational
                                    auto-encoder that can generate synthetic features of neighbors to augment the
                                    nodes and the node types with scarce links. Metapath-level augmentation
                                    concentrates on metapath aspect, which constructs metapath reachable graphs for
                                    different metapaths and estimates the graphons of them. By sampling and mixing
                                    up based on the graphons, MAHGA yields intra-metapath and inter-metapath
                                    augmentation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
                                    to validate the effectiveness of MAHGA. Experimental results demonstrate that
                                    our method improves the performances across a set of heterogeneous graph
                                    learning models and datasets.</p>

                                    dynamic user interest based on time-ordered user-item interactions plays a
                                    critical role in the real-world. Although existing deep learning-based
                                    recommendation systems show good performances, these methods have two main
                                    drawbacks. Firstly, user interest is the consequence of the coaction of many
                                    factors. However, existing methods do not fully explore potential influence
                                    factors and ignore the user-item interaction formation process. The
                                    coarse-grained modeling patterns cannot accurately reflect complex user interest
                                    and leads to suboptimal recommendation results. Furthermore, these methods are
                                    implicit and largely operate in a black-box fashion. It is difficult to
                                    interpret their modeling processes and recommendation results. Secondly,
                                    recommendation datasets usually exhibit scale-free distributions and some
                                    existing recommender systems take advantage of hyperbolic space to match the
                                    data distribution. But they ignore that the operations in hyperbolic space are
                                    more complex than that in Euclidean space which further increases the difficulty
                                    of model interpretation. To tackle the above shortcomings, we propose an
                                    Explainable Hyperbolic Temporal Point Process for User-Item Interaction Sequence
                                    Generation (EHTPP). Specifically, EHTPP regards each user-item interaction as an
                                    event in hyperbolic space and employs a temporal point process framework to
                                    model the probability of event occurrence. Considering that the complexity of
                                    user interest and the interpretability of the model,EHTPP explores four
                                    potential influence factors related to user interest and uses them to explicitly
                                    guide the probability calculation in the temporal point process. In order to
                                    validate the effectiveness of EHTPP, we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of
                                    EHTPP on three datasets compared with a few competitive baselines. Experimental
                                    results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performances of EHTPP.</p>

                                    learn node representation based on the graph topology and node attributes. The
                                    current mainstream GNN-based methods learn the representation of the target node
                                    by aggregating the attributes of its neighbor nodes. These methods still face
                                    two challenges: (1) In the neighborhood aggregation procedure, the attributes of
                                    each node would be propagated to its neighborhoods which may cause disturbance
                                    to the original attributes of the target node and cause over-smoothing in GNN
                                    iteration. (2) Because the representation of the target node is derived from the
                                    attributes and topology of its neighbors, the attributes and topological
                                    information of each neighbor have different effects on the representation of the
                                    target node. However, this different contribution has not been considered by the
                                    existing GNN-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN model named
                                    API-GNN (Attribute Preserving Oriented Interactive Graph Neural Network).
                                    API-GNN can not only reduce the disturbance of neighborhood aggregation to the
                                    original attribute of target node, but also explicitly model the different
                                    impacts of attribute and topology on node representation. We conduct experiments
                                    on six public real-world datasets to validate API-GNN on node classification and
                                    link prediction. Experimental results show that our model outperforms several

                                    Existing graph meta-learning methods mainly focus on capturing node-level
                                    relations, but they ignore task-level relations which are beneficial for

                                    for few-shot scenario, but existing graph few-shot learning methods have never

                                    are not only the homophilic connections formed by the same label nodes (similar
                                    nodes), but also the heterophilic connections formed by the different label
                                    nodes (dissimilar nodes). However, the existing GNN-based fraud detection
                                    methods just enhance the homophily in fraud graph and use the low-pass filter to

                                    Homophilic and Heterophilic Interactions (H2-FDetector for short). Firstly, we
                                    identify the homophilic and heterophilic connections with the supervision of
                                    labeled nodes. Next, we design a new information aggregation strategy to make
                                    the homophilic connections propagate similar information and the heterophilic
                                    connections propagate difference information. Finally, a prototype prior is
                                    introduced to guide the identification of fraudsters. Extensive experiments on
                                    two real public benchmark fraud detection tasks demonstrate that our method
                                    apparently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to
                                    learn representations for entities and relations. Most KGE models have gained
                                    great success, especially on extrapolation scenarios. Specifically, given an
                                    unseen triple (h, r, t), a trained model can still correctly predict t from (h,
                                    r, ?), or h from (?, r, t), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However,
                                    most existing KGE works focus on the design of delicate triple modeling
                                    function, which mainly tell us how to measure the plausibility of observed
                                    triples, but we have limited understanding of why the methods can extrapolate to
                                    unseen data, and what are the important factors to help KGE extrapolate.
                                    Therefore in this work, we attempt to, from a data relevant view, study KGE
                                    extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to unseen data? 2.
                                    How to design the KGE model with better extrapolation ability? For the problem
                                    1, we first discuss the impact factors for extrapolation and from relation,
                                    entity and triple level respectively, propose three Semantic Evidences (SEs),
                                    which can be observed from training set and provide important semantic
                                    information for extrapolation to unseen data. Then we verify the effectiveness
                                    of SEs through extensive experiments on several typical KGE methods, and
                                    demonstrate that SEs serve as an important role for understanding the
                                    extrapolation ability of KGE. For the problem 2, to make better use of the SE
                                    information for more extrapolative knowledge representation, we propose a novel
                                    GNN-based KGE model, called Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network
                                    (SE-GNN). Finally, through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR
                                    datasets, we show that SE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on Knowledge
                                    Graph Completion task and perform a better extrapolation ability.</p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract: </strong>User identity linkage is a task of
                                    recognizing the identities of the same user across different social networks
                                    (SN). Previous works tackle this problem via estimating the pairwise similarity
                                    between identities from different SN, predicting the label of identity pairs or
                                    selecting the most relevant identity pair based on the similarity scores.
                                    However, most of these methods ignore the results of previously matched
                                    identities, which could contribute to the linkage in following matching steps.
                                    To address this problem, we convert user identity linkage into a sequence
                                    decision problem and propose a reinforcement learning model to optimize the
                                    linkage strategy from the global perspective. Our method makes full use of both
                                    the social network structure and the history matched identities, and explores
                                    the long-term influence of current matching on subsequent decisions. We conduct
                                    experiments on different types of datasets, the results show that our method
                                    achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                                    heterogeneous networks plays a pivotal role in inter-network applications. The
                                    difficulty of anchor link prediction in heterogeneous networks lies in how to
                                    consider the factors affecting nodes alignment comprehensively. In recent years,
                                    predicting anchor links based on network embedding has become the main trend.
                                    For heterogeneous networks, previous anchor link prediction methods first
                                    integrate various types of nodes associated with a user node to obtain a fusion
                                    embedding vector from global perspective, and then predict anchor links based on
                                    the similarity between fusion vectors corresponding with different user nodes.
                                    However, the fusion vector ignores effects of the local type information on user
                                    nodes alignment. To address the challenge, we propose a novel type-aware anchor
                                    link prediction across heterogeneous networks (TALP), which models the effect of
                                    type information and fusion information on user nodes alignment from local and
                                    global perspective simultaneously. TALP can solve the network embedding and
                                    type-aware alignment under a unified optimization framework based on a two-layer
                                    graph attention architecture. Through extensive experiments on real
                                    heterogeneous network datasets, we demonstrate that TALP significantly
                                    outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>
