                            <p class="content"><strong>Abstract:</strong>Empathy is a crucial factor in open-domain conversations, which naturally shows one's caring and understanding to others. Though several methods have been proposed to generate empathetic responses, existing works often lead to monotonous empathy that refers to generic and safe expressions. In this paper, we propose to use explicit control to guide the empathy expression and design a framework DiffusEmp based on conditional diffusion language model to unify the utilization of dialogue context and attribute-oriented control signals. Specifically, communication mechanism, intent, and semantic frame are imported as multi-grained signals that control the empathy realization from coarse to fine levels. We then design a specific masking strategy to reflect the relationship between multi-grained signals and response tokens, and integrate it into the diffusion model to influence the generative process. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset EmpatheticDialogue show that our framework outperforms competitive baselines in terms of controllability, informativeness, and diversity without the loss of context-relatedness.</p>

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract:</strong>Zero-shot transfer learning for Dialogue State Tracking (DST) helps to handle a variety of task-oriented dialogue domains without the cost of collecting in-domain data. Existing works mainly study common data- or model-level augmentation methods to enhance the generalization but fail to effectively decouple the semantics of samples, limiting the zero-shot performance of DST. In this paper, we present a simple and effective "divide, conquer and combine" solution, which explicitly disentangles the semantics of seen data, and leverages the performance and robustness with the mixture-of-experts mechanism. Specifically, we divide the seen data into semantically independent subsets and train corresponding experts, the newly unseen samples are mapped and inferred with mixture-of-experts with our designed ensemble inference. Extensive experiments on MultiWOZ2.1 upon the T5-Adapter show our schema significantly and consistently improves the zero-shot performance, achieving the SOTA on settings without external knowledge, with only 10M trainable parameters1.</p>

Given English gold summaries and documents, sentence-level labels for extractive summarization are usually generated using heuristics. However, these monolingual labels created on English datasets may not be optimal on datasets of other languages, for that there is the syntactic or semantic discrepancy between different languages. In this way, it is possible to translate the English dataset to other languages and obtain different sets of labels again using heuristics. To fully leverage the information of these different sets of labels, we propose NLSSum (Neural Label Search for Summarization), which jointly learns hierarchical weights for these different sets of labels together with our summarization model. We conduct multilingual zero-shot summarization experiments on MLSUM and WikiLingua datasets, and we achieve state-of-the-art results using both human and automatic evaluations across these two datasets.</p>

However, previous zero-shot DST methods ignore the slot dependencies in a multidomain dialogue, resulting in sub-optimal performances when adapting to unseen domains. In this paper, we utilize slot prompts combination, slot values demonstration, and slot constraint object to model the slot-slot dependencies, slot-value dependency and slot-context dependency respectively. Specifically, each slot prompt consists of a slot-specific prompt and a slot-shared prompt to capture the shared knowledge across different domains.

However, current end-to-end dialogue systems often struggle to interface knowledge bases(KBs) with response smoothly and effectively. In this paper, we convert the raw knowledge into relation knowledge and integrated knowledge and then incorporate them into end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems. The relation knowledge extracted from knowledge triples is combined with dialogue history, aiming to enhance semantic inputs and support better language understanding. Integrated knowledge involves entities and relations by graph attention, assisting the model in generating informative responses. The experimental results on three public dialogue datasets show that our model improves over the previous state-of-the-art models in sentence fluency and informativeness.</p>

                                        <p class="content"><strong>Abstract:</strong>Sentence-level extractive summarization is a fundamental yet challenging task, and recent powerful approaches prefer to pick sentences sorted by the predicted probabilities until the length limit is reached, a.k.a. ``Top-K Strategy''. This length limit is fixed based on the validation set, resulting in the lack of flexibility. In this work, we propose a more flexible and accurate non-autoregressive method for single document extractive summarization, extracting a non-fixed number of summary sentences without the sorting step. We call our approach ThresSum as it picks sentences simultaneously and individually from the source document when the predicted probabilities exceed a threshold. During training, the model enhances sentence representation through iterative refinement and the intermediate latent variables receive some weak supervision with soft labels, which are generated progressively by adjusting the temperature with a knowledge distillation algorithm. Specifically, the temperature is initialized with high value and drops along with the iteration until a temperature of 1. Experimental results on CNN/DM and NYT datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of ThresSum, which significantly outperforms BERTSUMEXT with a substantial improvement of 0.74 ROUGE-1 score on CNN/DM.

                                            <p class="content"><strong>Abstract:</strong>A popular choice for extractive summarization is to conceptualize it as sentence-level classification, supervised by binary labels. While the common metric ROUGE prefers to measure the text similarity, instead of the performance of classifier. For example, BERTSUMEXT, the best extractive classifier so far, only achieves a precision of 32.9% at the top 3 extracted sentences (P@3) on CNN/DM dataset. It is obvious that current approaches cannot model the complex relationship of sentences exactly with 0/1 targets. In this paper, we introduce DistilSum, which contains teacher mechanism and student model. Teacher mechanism produces high entropy soft targets at a high temperature. Our student model is trained with the same temperature to match these informative soft targets and tested with temperature of 1 to distill for ground-truth labels. Compared with large version of BERTSUMEXT, our experimental result on CNN/DM achieves a substantial improvement of 0.99 ROUGE-L score (text similarity) and 3.95 P@3 score (performance of classifier).

                                <p class="content"><strong>Abstract:</strong>Sentence-level extractive text summarization is substantially a node classification task of network mining, adhering to the informative components and concise representations. There are lots of redundant phrases between extracted sentences, but it is difficult to model them exactly by the general supervised methods. Previous sentence encoders, especially BERT, specialize in modeling the relationship between source sentences. While, they have no ability to consider the overlaps of the target selected summary, and there are inherent dependencies among target labels of sentences. In this paper, we propose HAHSum (as shorthand for Hierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous Graph for Text Summarization), which well models different levels of information, including words and sentences, and spotlights redundancy dependencies between sentences. Our approach iteratively refines the sentence representations with redundancy-aware graph and delivers the label dependencies by message passing. Experiments on large scale benchmark corpus (CNN/DM, NYT, and NEWSROOM) demonstrate that HAHSum yields ground-breaking performance and outperforms previous extractive summarizers.</p>

                            <p class="content"><strong>Abstract:</strong>For sentence-level extractive summarization, there is a disproportionate ratio of selected and unselected sentences, leading to flatting the summary features when maximizing the accuracy. The imbalanced classification of summarization is inherent, which can’t be addressed by common algorithms easily. In this paper, we conceptualize the single-document extractive summarization as a rebalance problem and present a deep differential amplifier framework. Specifically, we first calculate and amplify the semantic difference between each sentence and all other sentences, and then apply the residual unit as the second item of the differential amplifier to deepen the architecture. Finally, to compensate for the imbalance, the corresponding objective loss of minority class is boosted by a weighted cross-entropy. In contrast to previous approaches, this model pays more attention to the pivotal information of one sentence, instead of all the informative context modeling by recurrent or Transformer architecture. We demonstrate experimentally on two benchmark datasets that our summarizer performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods. Our source code will be available on Github.</p>

In recent years, most of previous works regard NER as a sequence tagging task, including statistical models and deep learning methods. In this paper, we innovatively consider NER as a sequence transformation task in which the unlabeled sequences (source texts) are converted to labeled sequences (NER labels). In order to model this sequence transformation task, we design a sequence-to-sequence neural network, which combines a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layer to efficiently use sentence level tag information and the attention mechanism to capture the most important semantic information of the encoded sequence. In experiments, we evaluate different models both on a standard corpus consisting of news data and an unnormalized one consisting of short messages. Experimental results showed that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on recognizing short interdependence entity.</p>
